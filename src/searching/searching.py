# TO-DO: Implement a recursive implementation of binary search
def binary_search(arr, target, start, end):
    # Your code here
    # compare x with middle element
    # if x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index
    # else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right half subarray after the mid element
    # else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left half the left is is always lower in binary trees


    # STRETCH: implement an order-agnostic binary search
    # This version of binary search should correctly find
    # the target regardless of whether the input array is
    # sorted in ascending order or in descending order
    # You can implement this function either recursively
    # or iteratively
